On the subject of the Nine Hells, The Dragonborn have this to say: that before her eternal sleep atthe bottom of the Abyss, Tiamat, despairing the loss of her metallic children to Bahamut and wishingfor companionship, willed five daughters to rise from the waves of the Sea of Chaos: Aegiraxus theBlack, Angrochinach the Blue, Greipani the Green, Karixus the Red, and Gjalpithor the White. “Do yousee, Betrayer?” shrieked Tiamat into endless Night, knowing Bahamut would hear, “My children aregreater and more mighty than yours!” Being aspects of Tiamat, and thus borne of hate and envy, theSisters immediately fell to scheming and warring amongst themselves, playing cruel tricks, formingalliances only to betray them, and so on, until even Tiamat tired of their bickering.

The Su'krash Tribe claim to be descendants of Aegiraxus, incidentally, while the neighboring Halishaof Telsus Island say they are the daughters of Karixus, which I suppose explains why they areconstantly slaughtering each other over the fishing rights to a few miles of rocky shoreline. Infact the Halisha say the Sisters even turned on Tiamat, and drove her into the Sea of Chaos; asuitably matricidal tale from a tribe obsessed with such violent rites of succession. Of course theyblame Aegiraxus as the instigator.

But to return to our theme: in the manner of all sisters, these Sisters were more alike than theycared to admit, and this likeness only fueled their competition. As the tale is told they createdthe races of chromatic dragons in their own images to fight their wars, lesser than themselves butstill awesome in their power; and these chromatic dragons amassed mighty armies of fiends and pitthem against each other for time beyond counting.

These “Wars Of The Sisterhood” raged across every Plane of existence, it is said, and so terriblewere they that the stars themselves wept, and fell from the heavens in despair. And wherever thestars fell, their sorrow raged as an inferno, and together these fallen stars created the layers ofthe Nine Hells: infinite, empty planes of sorrow and pain. This is no doubt more metaphoricalnonsense from a people who seem to think randomly scratching runes in the dirt constitutes highliterature; the cosmology of the Nine Hells is of course well understood – refer to my ownCosmology of the Nine Hells for a thorough accounting.

The Dragonborn say that eventually Bahamut’s children, Woden, Syf, Mimir, Thorus and Freya, whom wecall The Five, grew tired of the endless horrors of the Sisters’ bickering, and decided tointervene. They created the races of metallic dragons in their image to counter the chromaticdragons; likewise the celestial races – the Angels, the Archon and the Eladrin – they set beforethe fiends. Now united by a common enemy, the infernal armies joined together under the leadershipof Baal, first son of Karixus, and met the celestials in battle.

And here at last we begin to approach something resembling an accurate accounting, for as to thedetails of the celestials’ war against the fiends this much at least is supported by the scholarAnaraxus. In his Tome of Revelation, Anaraxus reports the two armies fought to a standstill,neither side giving or receiving any quarter, and war seemed everlasting, until at last Bahamutherself, the Platinum Queen, descended from Mount Celestia and led the Armies Of the Five in a finalassault on Baal’s stronghold in Nessus, the Ninth Circle Of Hell. The fiends were defeated utterly,and imprisoned in the Nine Hells for eternity, and the Five set their armies as eternal guardiansagainst their escape. Anaraxus further tells us Baal himself was slain by his second-in-command,Asmodeus, who even now rules as Lord Of Hell, plotting revenge. And every fiend and devil in theHells remembers this defeat, and is consumed by hate for the Platinum Queen and all her works.

How fascinating it is that the Dragonborn clutch so much apocryphal nonsense to their scaly bosom,– weeping stars and burning sorrows, indeed! – eschewing the primary sources in favour of oraltelling and retelling which must always be incomplete and misleading. Their traditions containkernels of truth, but it is so distorted that it is only through the diligence of the careful anddedicated scholar such as your humble author that fact may be separated from fancy. Verily, theenlightened reader may refer to my “Physiognomy and Taxonomy of Dragons” in this very tome for acogent rebuttal of the more ridiculous aspects of this account; for Dragonborn are no more fallencelestials than I am a Mountain Dwarf.
